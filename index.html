    <h1>CHESS GAME.</h1>
    <P>Chess is a strategic board game that pits two players against each other in a battle of intellect, foresight, and tactical skill. Played on an 8x8 grid with 64 squares, each player commands 16 pieces—pawns, rooks, knights, bishops, a queen, and a king—each with unique movement patterns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, meaning placing it in a position where it cannot escape capture. Chess combines elements of strategy, prediction, and patience, making it one of the most popular and enduring games worldwide.</P>

        <h2>How chess started.</h2>
        <p>Chess originated in northern India around the 6th century CE with the game <i>chaturanga</i>, a strategy game that mirrored ancient military formations and featured divisions resembling infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots. As the game spread to Persia, it was known as <i>shatranj</i>, where the names of the pieces evolved, and the gameplay began to shift into more recognizable forms. With the Islamic expansion, <i>shatranj</i> traveled to the Middle East and North Africa and eventually reached Europe by the early medieval period, where it continued to develop. The game’s appeal transcended cultures, and the term <b>checkmate</b> emerged from the Persian phrase <i>shah mat</i>,” meaning <b>the king is helpless</b>.”</p>
            <p>In Europe, chess evolved significantly in the 15th century, especially in Spain and Italy, where pieces took on new roles. For instance, the "queen" and "bishop" acquired enhanced powers, making the game faster-paced and more dynamic. This version is the foundation of modern chess. In 1851, the first international chess tournament was held in London, further establishing chess as a competitive sport. Over centuries, chess became associated with strategic thought and intelligence, and today, it’s both a globally competitive sport and a timeless pastime, symbolizing a universal appreciation for strategy and intellectual challenge.</p>
